# YFS
YFS(Yet another file system) is a simple distributed file system implementation in the spirit of MIT's graduate courses in Distributed Systems -- 6.824.

The file system is implemented in C++ programing language. Include the following parts:

Lab 1 - Lock Server
Lab 2 - Basic File Server
Lab 3 - MKDIR, UNLINK, and Locking
Lab 4 - Caching Lock Server
Lab 5 - Caching Extent Server + Consistency
Lab 6 - Paxos
Lab 7 - Replicated lock server

for Lab 8, I am planning to implement an additional features ontop of the existing file systems.
